                <h2 class='heading'>Undergraduate Research Assistantship (URA)</h2>
                <p class='section__text'> Undergraduate students may be funded for summer research projects. The topic should be of mutual interest. Senior level undergraduate students (3rd year and above) with background in statistics / data science / mathematics / computer science
                    are encouraged to discuss potential projects in person. Or you may also talk to me to select from my available pool of projects. An experience in R and Python will be considered as an asset. For a fruitful discussion, please bring
                    your short CV with an unofficial copy of your transcripts of record.
                </p>
                <h2 class='heading'>Graduate Research Assistantship (GRA)</h2>
                <p class='section__text'>
                    Prospective graduate students must meet the admission eligibility criteria for the <a href='https://www.tru.ca/future/admissions/graduate-admission.html' target='_blank'>Master of Science in Data Science</a> or
                    <a href='https://www.tru.ca/future/admissions/graduate-admission.html' target='_blank'>Master of Science, Environmental Science </a> programs at TRU. An ideal student should have good grades in upper level undergraduate statistics/data
                    science courses such as statistical inference, Bayesian statistics, regression, and machine learning. Research experience at the undergraduate level will be considered as an asset. Students with experience in R, LaTeX, and scientific
                    writing will be given priority. While I may support my own graduate students with funding, the applicants are also encouraged to look for other award/scholarship opportunities such as NSERC/CIHR CGS, BCGS, Graduate Student Research
                    Mentorship, Ken Lepin, Dr. Sherman Jen and Environmental Science and Natural Resource Science Fellowship Award at TRU. These awards/scholarships have their internal deadlines - please apply before the deadline. A small sum of money
                    is also available as teaching assistantships for qualified applicants. When you approach me, please forward me your short CV, unofficial transcripts, and English language proficiency (for international students only) score for a fruitful
                    discussion.
